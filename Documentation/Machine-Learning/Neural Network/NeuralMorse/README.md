# NeuralMorse

NeuralMorse is a project that utilizes neural networks to translate text to Morse code and vice versa. This tool provides a convenient way to convert messages between human-readable text and the Morse code representation. Whether you want to communicate in Morse code or decode Morse code messages, NeuralMorse has got you covered.

## Features

- Text to Morse Code Conversion: Easily convert any text input into its equivalent Morse code representation.
- Morse Code to Text Conversion: Decode Morse code messages and convert them back into readable text.
- Neural Network Model: NeuralMorse employs a trained neural network model to accurately perform the text-to-Morse code and Morse code-to-text translations.
- User-Friendly Interface: The user interface of NeuralMorse is designed to be intuitive and easy to use, making it accessible to users of all skill levels.

## How to Use

1. Clone the NeuralMorse repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies and libraries. `pip install numpy keras tensorflow`
3. Run the NeuralMorse application. `python test.py`
4. Choose the desired conversion mode: text to Morse code or Morse code to text.
5. Enter the input text or Morse code message.
6. Click the "Convert" button to obtain the translation result.
7. The translated output will be displayed on the screen.

## Dependencies

NeuralMorse relies on the following dependencies:

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Keras

Make sure you have these dependencies installed on your system before running NeuralMorse.
