# Guide

The code performs binary image classification using a CNN model. Here is a breakdown of the steps and the rationale behind using this approach:

## Purpose of the Code

The code aims to train a CNN model to classify images into two classes (binary classification).

## Steps

1. Import the necessary libraries and modules such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and TensorFlow.
2. Define the directory path where the images are located, the desired image size, and the batch size for training.
3. Create an image data generator using `ImageDataGenerator` to preprocess the images by rescaling their pixel values and splitting the dataset into training and validation subsets.
4. Generate the training data iterator using the `flow_from_directory` method of the image data generator, providing the image directory, target size, batch size, and class mode.
5. Generate the validation data iterator in a similar manner as the training data iterator.
6. Build the CNN model using the `Sequential` API from Keras, adding convolutional, pooling, flatten, and dense layers. The model uses the ReLU activation function for intermediate layers and a sigmoid activation function for the output layer.
7. Compile the model by specifying the optimizer, loss function, and evaluation metrics.
8. Train the model using the `fit` method, providing the training data iterator and validation data iterator, along with the number of epochs.
9. Plot and visualize the training and validation accuracy and loss using Matplotlib.

## Rationale for Using this Approach

1. **Convolutional Neural Network:** CNNs are effective for image classification tasks as they can capture spatial relationships and hierarchical features in images.
2. **ImageDataGenerator:** The `ImageDataGenerator` allows for efficient preprocessing and augmentation of image data, improving model generalization and performance.
3. **Batch Training:** Training the model in batches helps to handle large datasets, reduces memory requirements, and allows for parallel processing.
4. **Sequential Model:** The `Sequential` API provides a simple and intuitive way to build neural network models by stacking layers sequentially.
5. **Binary Classification:** The model is configured for binary classification with a single output neuron and a sigmoid activation function.
6. **Evaluation Metrics:** The model is evaluated using accuracy as the performance metric and binary cross-entropy as the loss function.
7. **Visualization:** Plotting the training and validation accuracy and loss helps to assess model performance and identify overfitting or underfitting.

Overall, this approach combines the power of CNNs for image classification with the convenience of TensorFlow and Keras libraries, enabling the efficient training and evaluation of a binary image classification model.
